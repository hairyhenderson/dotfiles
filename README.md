# dotfiles

I'm using [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage my dotfiles.

## Setup

To set these up on a new machine, first [install `rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm#installation), then:

- clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles`:
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:hairyhenderson/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
- run the dotfile setup script:
```console
$ ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
...
```
